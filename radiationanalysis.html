									Our task was to develop a method to help prevent radiological contamination for
									glove box operators working
									at the lab. We were given 24 hours to complete our project, from ideation to
									completion, and we ended up bringing home the
									$2500 scholarship from our design.

								<p><strong> <i> <u>The Problem</u></i>: </strong>
									Los Alamos National Labs has a rather archaic system for radioactive waste disposal.
									To try to alleviate this,
									they decided to host tournaments for students to devise ideas for ways to tackle a
									few primary issues with their
									current system.

								<div style="padding-left: 2vw;">
									<li> Operators are regularly dosed with radiation due to the nature of their work
										environment. </li>
									<li> Operators expose themselves to contaminant risks due to some materials being
										sharp and cutting gloves. </li>
									<li> Dropping waste into the disposal containers can destroy the internal liner,
										exposing the workspace to radiation.
									</li>
								</div>
								</p>



								<div style="padding-top: 1vh"></div>

								<p><strong> <i> <u>Design Considerations</u></i>: </strong>
									Our team decided to try to meet these goals utilizing telepresence. Trying to remove
									the operator from the assembly, while not
									severely hindering their ability to fullfil their role. To do this, we decided to
									use a <a
										href="https://www.dobot-robots.com/products/education/magician-lite.html">Dobot
										Magician Lite</a>, as they were made available for project teams, as well as a
									stepper-motor driven conveyor belt. All other components were technically
									supplementary, but were effective
									at conveying our idea. Our final design was decided on Friday, so to convey this
									information to our advisor from
									Los Alamos I created this animation in 2 hours using Blender.

									We got to building Saturday morning around 8am. Our roboticists began programming
									the robot, while the electrical and mechanical
									people got to work on the enclosure. I made the user interface with <a
										href="https://github.com/hoffstadt/DearPyGui">PyGUI</a> pretty
									quickly, it was chosen since the documentation is fantastic. Below are a collection
									of images from our workspace taken by the event
									photographer showing our working Saturday. We were extremely tired due to the nature
									of the project timeframe, our data preservation skills
									were rather poor given our rushed timeframe, much of it had to be submitted with the
									submission with the data cleared from our machines.

									Another restriction was that we had to abide by the randomly generated categories
									distributed to the class. These categories were generated using <a
										href="https://gunnar-clovis.itch.io/game-jam-theme-generator"> Gunnar Clovis'
										Game Jam Theme Generator</a> While the original seed is lost to time, we took a
									screenshot of the list and attempted to ideate off these selections. We definitely
									took creative liberties regarding narratives to match themes.

									<strong> <i> <u>Ideation</u></i>: </strong>

									Given our self-set restrictions, we were extremely limited in the potential games we
									could develop. There are fantastic virtual reality games that utilize features such
									as artificial locomotion and wide-open spaces, but given the time constraints and
									restrictions on enterprise software (Such as VR Inverse Kinematics systems), we
									decided to step the scale down a lot. We eventually landed on 3 separate designs,
									then took the project to <a href="https://meteor.ame.asu.edu/">Meteor Studios</a>,
									the ASU Virtual Reality development studio,
									to ask for their
									feedback on our design documents. We called our three proposal Heresy, Spaceman, and
									Robot.
								</p>

								<i><strong> Spaceman: </strong> Man and Machine, Atomic Era, The Game Lies</i>

								</p>
								<div style="margin-left: 1em;">
									<p style="margin-bottom:0px;">
										<u>Pros </u>:
									<div style="margin-left:1em;">
										<li>
											All interactions are within the focal range of the headset.
										</li>
										<li>
											Zero gravity environments are very fun to new VR users.
										</li>
										<li>
											Only required to make one intricate scene.
										</li>
									</div>

									<p style="margin-bottom:0px;">
										<u>Cons </u>:
									<div style="margin-left:1em;">
										<li>
											Reading Documentation is only fun in a party setting <a
												href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/341800/Keep_Talking_and_Nobody_Explodes/">(Keep

												distance</a> is unknown.
										</li>
									</div>
									<p style="margin-bottom:0px;">
										<u>Denial Justification </u>:
									<div style="margin-left:1em;">
										<li>
											Our board-game prototyping was extremely boring in practice.
										</li>
										<li>
											Not enough unique systems for a team of our size.
										</li>
									</div>
									</p>

								</div>

								<i><strong>Heresy:</strong> Blink, Down For So Long, Hurt </i>
								<p style="margin-bottom:0.2em">
									Explore an abandoned house, imbuing firearms with holy spells to defeat demons
									trying to enter the world of the living.
								</p>
								<div style="margin-left: 1em;">
									<p style="margin-bottom:0px;">
										<u>Pros </u>:
									<div style="margin-left:1em;">
										<li>
											Action-oriented concept.
										</li>
										<li>
											Would stand alone as a traditional game.
										</li>
										<li>
											Enough content to justify the team size.
										</li>
									</div>

									<p style="margin-bottom:0px;">
										<u>Cons </u>:
									<div style="margin-left:1em;">
										<li>
											Required too many button presses for game-necessary actions.
										</li>
										<li>
											Artificial Locomotion tends to be nauseating for new VR users.
										</li>
									</div>
									<p style="margin-bottom:0px;">
										<u>Denial Justification </u>:
									<div style="margin-left:1em;">
										<li>
											Artificial Locomotion nausea would make testing/playing for long periods
											difficult.
										</li>
										<li>
											Demo area was insufficient for the space required.
										</li>

								</i>
								<p style="margin-bottom:0.2em">
									Pilot a mechanical war machine, defeating other machines and collecting their parts
									to improve the combat-capabilities of your own.
								</p>
								<div style="margin-left: 1em;">
									<p style="margin-bottom:0px;">
										<u>Pros </u>:
									<div style="margin-left:1em;">
										<li>
											Exciting Concept.
										</li>
										<li>
											Would stand alone as a traditional game.
										</li>
										<li>
											Enough content to justify the team size.
										</li>
										<li>
											All interactions are justifiably within interaction range.
										</li>
									</div>

									<p style="margin-bottom:0px;">
										<u>Cons </u>:
									<div style="margin-left:1em;">
										<li>
											Requires rather advanced AI
										</li>
									</div>
									<p style="margin-bottom:0px;">
										<u>Acceptance Justification </u>:
									<div style="margin-left:1em;">
										<li>
											All interactions occur within reach, which means button presses are not
											required.
										</li>
										<li>
											Only high-definition space is the cockpit, all other areas can be
											lower-resolution.
										</li>

								<p> <i><u><strong>Test Build:</strong></u></i> Once we had made our final selection, we
									started getting to work. We started off by
									making a quick demo to test controls and basic mechanics, this project would be the
									basis for our final design. To minimize the work required,
									some design choices were made. Primarily, this version of the game has a very simple
									user-interface, no weapon switching, and uses a lot of prototyping assets from the
									asset distribution platform <a href="https://syntystore.com/">Synty</a> under a
									studio license one of our team members purchased.
								</p>
								<p>
									Essentially all of this initial build is lost due to the license expiring. If you
									were to repurchase the asset packs required you could definitely reconstruct the
									build from the <a href="https://github.com/cjmcgreg/Game-Jam-3"> GitHub
										Repository</a>. All that survived are the assets I created, as well as a
									singular video from the debugging phase of development while we were trying to
									resolve clipping issues. Given this demo was <b>made in 3 days</b>, it was actually
									rather
									impressive, featuring a full tutorial, voice acting, and a 3D user interface that
									moved separate from the player to simulate movement.
								</p>

								<video width="100%" height="auto" controls>
									<source src="images/IntoTheVoid/Jam3/inEngineTest.mp4" type="video/mp4">
									Your Browser does not support video playback :(
								</video>

								<div style="padding-top: 1vh"></div>

								<p style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">
									<i><u><strong>Initial Art:</strong></u></i> As I compulsively save and preserve my
									own work,
									almost all art assets used in this project have been retained. This video
									demonstrates the armor system, as well as the face-shield deploying, which was cut
									from the final project as removing visibility from the player made the experience
									significantly less fun.
								</p>

								<video width="100%" height="auto" controls>
									<source src="images/IntoTheVoid/Jam3/BlenderInitialModel.mp4" type="video/mp4">
									Your Browser does not support video playback :(
								</video>

								<div style="padding-top: 1vh"></div>

								<p style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">
									Here is a dump of initial art that made it into the 3-day demo. It was not a busy
									weekend for me, and much of it would be reused for the final project so I worked 8+
									hours a day to ensure these would be finished in time for the submission on Monday.
								</p>

								<div style="padding-top: 1vh"></div>

								<div class="gallery" align="center">
									<div class="thumbnails">
										<img src="images/IntoTheVoid/Jam3/VoidPre.png" alt="VOIDPre" />
										<img src="images/IntoTheVoid/Jam3/VoidPre_Posed.png" alt="VOIDPrePosed" />

										<img src="images/IntoTheVoid/Jam3/VoidPre_Variations.png"
											alt="No Image Loaded" />
									</div>
								</div>

								<div style="padding-top: 1vh"></div>

								<p style="margin-bottom:0.5em;">
									Taking inspiration from previous projects, to add enemy variety with very little
									labor I decided to manually draw all the textures in GIMP, switching out the base
									colors and dirt maps to create enemy variety from simply loading different
									materials. While this was extremely important for this demo, as there was no weapon
									variety, it also carries over into the final game. Its especially helpful in Virtual
									Reality, where its difficult to differentiate shapes at distance, so the colors
									worked wonders for making enemies identifiable at a quick glance.
								</p>

								<p>
									<strong> <i> <u>Game Design Document</u></i>: </strong>

									Because we had to submit a Game Design Document (GDD) to get access to course
									resources, I produced this to show off to the class. This document covers the
									majority of the major game themes
									and features, at least as we believed was possible from the start. This document
									also goes into basic functions, such as player input for both
									traditional and VR controls, and a general writeup for how specific mechanics work,
									both to the user and on a technical side. Some of this stuff never made it to the
									final build
									due to performance issues, but for the most part this document remains a fairly
									accurate representation of the final game.

									<strong> <i> <u>Art Development</u></i>: </strong>

									Since my department was art and general management, I spent most of my time herding
									group members and developing art assets. Below is a dump of development screenshots
									of individual assets.

								</div>

								<div style="padding-top: 1vh"></div>

								<p>
									<strong> <i> <u>Post-Mortem</u></i>: </strong>

									I learned a lot working on this project. Not only about PLC programming, which was
									my target area of improvement, but
									also interfacing with businesses. Talking to individuals along the entire production
									process from design, sales, and fabrication to learn
									how to correctly integrate the donated hardware. I am extremely proud of the final
									project, as it taught me a lot about UI design,
									PLC programming, panel-design, weatherproofing, and various other skills. We manages
									to hit all of our target requirements while using none
									of the budget. I will bring other members from my club in to do some beautification
									passes, such as sanding the dirty aluminum table to reseal it,
									as well as add wire-channels to make it easier to move and lower-risk of breaking
									from long-term usage.
